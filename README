This is the Geocoding project based on JGeocoder (http://jgeocoder.sourceforge.net/) that was release on 2008.

A more comprehensive evaluation was done using the CASS STAGE 1 test set (containing 150,000 messy addresses and their target correct addresses). JGeocoder was debugged to be able to run through the test set. Full evaluation write up will be available on my Blog.

The H2 driver was updated to H2-1.3.164.jar instead of the old version, The new version solves concurrency issue (doing multiple geo database call at the same time).

Refer to my blog for more documentation: http://blogs.senxu.net/
